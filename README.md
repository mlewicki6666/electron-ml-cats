# Electron Cats

App done as a technical skill test using Electron JS, React JS and React Testing Library. UI is very minimalistic, I spent as much time trying to improve the app technically. 
To run the App create a `.env` file and fill it with base API url (https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com).

### Potential Improvements (If I had more time)

- Add more complex testing
- Improve UI
- Add more typing and generally improve it
- Add error handling
