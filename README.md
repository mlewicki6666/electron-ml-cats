# Electron Cats

### Description

App was done as a technical skill review using Electron JS, React JS and React Testing Library. UI is very minimalistic, I spent as much time trying to improve the app technically. 
To run the App create a `.env` file and fill it with base API url (https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com). Template file is also added to the repo. 

## Technologies

- **ElectronJS**: Cross-platform desktop application framework.
- **Electron Forge**: Boilerplate and tooling for Electron applications.
- **React**: Frontend UI library.
- **Material UI**: React components library.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for JavaScript.
- **Webpack**: Module bundler.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for fetching data.
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library**: Testing tools.

### Steps:

#### Install dependencies:

```Bash
npm install
```

#### Create a `.env` file and fill it with environment variables based on the [`template.env`](template.env)

#### Start the development server:

```Bash
npm run start
```

#### Build the production-ready application:

```Bash
npm run make
```

### Potential Improvements (If I had more time)

- Add more complex testing
- Improve UI
- Add more typing and generally improve it
- Add error handling
